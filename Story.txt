I've been in Montreal, Quebec, Canada for a few months now with my family, and it has been so
tough to meet new people, or find fun things to do. Before I moved from Sao Paolo, Brazil,
a friend told me about an app called Home Away From Home. He said he used it
when he was living in Tokyo to meet up with other Brazilians and get some help
to get settled in. I signed up when I got here, but I've been so busy trying to
find a daycare with Toddlr, I haven't had a chance to check it out much.

Lemme take a look at whats going on. Oh cool, I can see a bunch of people in
the same situation as me! Brazilians in Montreal, and a map with a bunch of events
and some are super close to me! Let's start by seeing if
there's anyone with an expertise in finance, since I REALLY need to open a
canadian bank account! Okay there's quite a few people, guess I'll check out
some profiles. Oscar seems pretty nice, he's also an expert in nightlife, thats
cool! I'm not a big club goer though. I've always been more of an outdoorsy
type, maybe stay in an play boardgames. Maybe I'll see if someone else has an
sports expertise. Jose has an expertise in sports, I'll check out his
profile. Great! Finance, sports, and fitness, this is perfect! I'll shoot him
a message.

I'll ask him if he can help me find a decent bank and open an account. I've been
using my Brazilian bank account but the exchange rate is killing me, and
everyone here uses their card or phone to pay, I'd like to be able to do that!
Plus, I'll need it for when I start working as a software developer. Great, he
said that after work on Thursday we can go do that!

Y'know what, Since I'm here with Jose, I'll ask him if he knows about any cool
sport events anytime soon. When I was still living in Brazil, I loved to go
for long bike rides, and play soccer. I made so many friends playing sports
back home, it would probably be a great way to meet some people here! Oh great,
Jose sent me a link to a pick up soccer ga me at Jarry park saturday afternoon,
right near where I live! There's already 10 people going! It ends early enough, I should have time
after to head out and snap some pics of the full moon too, since I saw on
NightSkydper it's going to be a super clear night!

I really enjoy boardgames too, and I saw that there were a few people with that
expertise. I think I'll make an event to try to meet some more people. Since I'm
already going to play soccer on this Saturday, and next Saturday morning, I'm going
to brunch, but I don't usually wait that long thanks to the BrunchTime app
maybe I'll set this up for saturday afternoon. Yeah, boardgames in the park near
the fountain would probably be a lot
of fun!

All right, I've got a plan to set up a bank account, a soccer game planned, and
I'll be meeting some people for boardgames! This is great, I'll finally start
integrating into my home! This app was so helpful!
